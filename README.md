# Techyjaunt-To-Do-List
TO-DO-LIST

This project is a simple web application where users can manage their tasks by adding, completing, filtering, and deleting them. The app uses DOM manipulation, event handling, and local storage to ensure tasks persist even after page reloads. This application is a practical exercise for practicing core frontend skills.

Features

Add Tasks: Users can add new tasks to the task list.

Mark Tasks as Completed: Users can mark tasks as done, visually separating them from pending tasks.

Undo Completed Tasks: Users can revert completed tasks back to pending status.

Filter Tasks: Users can filter tasks by all, completed, or pending categories.

Delete Tasks: Users can delete individual tasks from the list.

Persist Data with Local Storage: All tasks are saved in the browser's local storage, so they persist across page reloads.
